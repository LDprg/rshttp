A http crate written in rust

## FAQ

### Why another crate?

Well this is not intendet for real world usage. It is just me having fun implementing a web server/client.

### Still why?

Whats the best way to understand web? Yes, implementing the web!
And this repo is an attempt to do so.

### Why rustls?

I did want to use no dependency for this project. However as it turns out I do not want to write tls, so rustls was the easiest choice.
